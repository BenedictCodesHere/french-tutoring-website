## Description

The page has 3 different themes/styling options, which the user can choose from depending on their learning goal. They are:

2. French for kids
3. French for fun

Please note that the index.html has a default styling of "French for Fun".

There is also a Youtube widget embedded, which populates a video to the page based on a call to the Youtube Data API. 

The Unsplash API is also made use of, to populate a high-definition image to the page showcasing different culturally relevant references (e.g. Tintin for the kids version, French cuisine for the Fun version, etc.)

The application makes use of Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML, CSS.
